Troubleshooting

This chapter posts some information about possibly common errors in building
or running |ns3| programs.

Build errors
************

Run-time errors
***************

Sometimes, errors can occur with a program after a successful build. These are
run-time errors, and can commonly occur when memory is corrupted or pointer
values are unexpectedly null.

Here is an example of what might occur:::

    $ ./waf --run tcp-point-to-point
    Entering directory '/home/tomh/ns-3-nsc/build'
    Compilation finished successfully 
    Command ['/home/tomh/ns-3-nsc/build/debug/examples/tcp-point-to-point'] exited with code -11 

The error message says that the program terminated unsuccessfully, but it is
not clear from this information what might be wrong. To examine more
closely, try running it under the `gdb debugger
<http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/>`_:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ ./waf --run tcp-point-to-point --command-template="gdb %s"
    Entering directory '/home/tomh/ns-3-nsc/build'
    Compilation finished successfully

    (gdb) run

    136       Ptr<Socket> localSocket = socketFactory->CreateSocket ();
    (gdb) p localSocket
    $1 = {m_ptr = 0x3c5d65}
    (gdb) p socketFactory
    $2 = {m_ptr = 0x0}
    (gdb) quit
    The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y

Note first the way the program was invoked-- pass the command to run as an
argument to the command template "gdb %s".  

This tells us that there was an attempt to dereference a null pointer
socketFactory.

Let's look around line 136 of tcp-point-to-point, as gdb suggests:

.. sourcecode:: cpp

  Ptr<SocketFactory> socketFactory = n2->GetObject<SocketFactory> (Tcp::iid);
  Ptr<Socket> localSocket = socketFactory->CreateSocket ();
  localSocket->Bind ();

The culprit here is that the return value of GetObject is not being checked and
may be null.  

Sometimes you may need to use the `valgrind memory checker
<http://valgrind.org>`_ for more subtle errors. Again, you invoke the use of
valgrind similarly::

    $ ./waf --run tcp-point-to-point --command-template="valgrind %s"
