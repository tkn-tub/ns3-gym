Conclusion

Futures
*******

This document is intended as a living document.  We hope and expect it to 
grow over time to cover more and more of the nuts and bolts of |ns3|.  

Writing manual and tutorial chapters is not something we all get excited about,
but it is very important to the project.  If you are an expert in one of these
areas, please consider contributing to |ns3| by providing one of these
chapters; or any other chapter you may think is important.

Closing
*******

|ns3| is a large and complicated system.  It is impossible to cover all 
of the things you will need to know in one small tutorial.  Readers
who want to learn more are encouraged to read the following additional
documentation:

* The |ns3| manual
* The |ns3| model library documentatio
* The |ns3| Doxygen (API documentation)
* The |ns3| wiki

-- The |ns3| development team.
