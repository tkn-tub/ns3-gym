/**
 * \ingroup netdevice
 *
 * \brief Network layer to device interface
 *
 * This interface defines the API which the IP and ARP
 * layers need to access to manage an instance of a network device 
 * layer. It currently does not support MAC-level 
 * multicast but this should not be too hard to add by adding
 * extra methods to register MAC multicast addresses to
 * filter out unwanted packets before handing them to the
 * higher layers.
 *
 * In Linux, this interface is analogous to the interface
 * just above dev_queue_xmit() (i.e., IP packet is fully
 * constructed with destination MAC address already selected).
 * 
 * If you want to write a new MAC layer, you need to subclass
 * this base class and implement your own version of the
 * pure virtual methods in this class.
 *
 * This class was designed to hide as many MAC-level details as 
 * possible from the perspective of layer 3 to allow a single layer 3
 * to work with any kind of MAC layer. Specifically, this class 
 * encapsulates the specific format of MAC addresses used by a
 * device such that the layer 3 does not need any modification
 * to handle new address formats. This means obviously that the
 * NetDevice class must know about the address format of all potential 
 * layer 3 protocols through its GetMulticast methods: the current
 * API has been optimized to make it easy to add new MAC protocols,
 * not to add new layer 3 protocols.
