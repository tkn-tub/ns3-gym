/**
 * \ingroup tcp
 *
 * \brief An implementation of TCP Scalable
 *
 * Scalable improves TCP performance to better utilize the available bandwidth
 * of a highspeed wide area network by altering NewReno congestion window
 * adjustment algorithm.
 *
 * When congestion has not been detected, for each ACK received in an RTT,
 * Scalable increases its cwnd per:
 *
 *         cwnd = cwnd + 0.01                  (1)
 *
 * Following Linux implementation of Scalable, we use 50 instead of 100 to
 * account for delayed ACK.
 *
 * On the first detection of congestion in a given RTT, cwnd is reduced based
 * on the following equation:
 *
 *         cwnd = cwnd - ceil(0.125 * cwnd)       (2)
 *
 * More information: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/956981.956989
