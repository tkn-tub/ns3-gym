/**
 * \brief Defines the TCP option of kind 3 (window scale option) as in \RFC{1323}
 *
 * For more efficient use of high bandwidth networks, a larger TCP window size
 * may be used. The TCP window size field controls the flow of data and its
 * value is limited to between 2 and 65,535 bytes.
 *
 * Since the size field cannot be expanded, a scaling factor is used.
 * The TCP window scale option, as defined in \RFC{1323}, is an option used
 * to increase the maximum window size from 65,535 bytes to 1 gigabyte.
 * Scaling up to larger window sizes is a part of what is necessary for TCP Tuning.
 *
 * The window scale option is used only during the TCP 3-way handshake.
 * The window scale value represents the number of bits to left-shift the
 * 16-bit window size field. The window scale value can be set from 0
 * (no shift) to 14 for each direction independently. Both sides must
 * send the option in their SYN segments to enable window scaling in
 * either direction.
