 *
 * This class contains the H-TCP implementation of TCP, according to
 * Internet-Draft draft-leith-tcp-htcp-03 and its related paper,
 * "H-TCP: TCP for high-speed and long-distance networks"
 * H-TCP is a congestion control protocol suitable for high bandwidth-delay
 * product networks. It is fair to similar flows present in the network and 
 * also friendly with conventional TCP. It also makes use of free 
 * bandwidth when it is available.
