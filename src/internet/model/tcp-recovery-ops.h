 * component. Subclasses of TcpRecoveryOps should modify TcpSocketState variables
 * upon three condition:
 *
 * - EnterRecovery (when the first loss is guessed)
 * - DoRecovery (each time a duplicate ACK or an ACK with SACK information is received)
 * - ExitRecovery (when the sequence transmitted when the socket entered the
 * Recovery phase is ACKed, therefore ending phase).
 *
 * Each condition is represented by a pure virtual method.
