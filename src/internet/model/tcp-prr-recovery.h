 * \brief An implementation of PRR
 *
 * PRR is an algorithm that determines TCP's sending rate in fast
 * recovery. PRR avoids excessive window reductions and aims for
 * the actual congestion window size at the end of recovery to be as
 * close as possible to the window determined by the congestion control
 * algorithm. PRR also improves accuracy of the amount of data sent
 * during loss recovery.
