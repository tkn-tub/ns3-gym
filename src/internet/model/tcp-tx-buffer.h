/**
 * \ingroup tcp
 *
 * \brief Tcp sender buffer
 *
 * The class keeps track of all data that the application wishes to transmit to
 * the other end. When the data is acknowledged, it is removed from the buffer.
 * The buffer has a maximum size, and data is not saved if the amount exceeds
 * the limit. Packets can be added to the class through the method Add(). An
 * important thing to remember is that all the data managed is strictly
 * sequential. It can be divided into blocks, but all the data follow a strict
 * ordering. That order is managed through SequenceNumber.
 *
 * In other words, this buffer contains numbered bytes (e.g., 1,2,3), and the
 * class is allowed to return only ordered (using "<" as operator) subsets
 * (e.g. 1,2 or 2,3 or 1,2,3).
 *
 * The data structure underlying this is composed by two distinct packet lists.
 * The first (SentList) is initially empty, and it contains the packets
 * returned by the method CopyFromSequence. The second (AppList) is initially
 * empty, and it contains the packets coming from the applications, but that
 * are not transmitted yet as segments. To discover how the chunks are managed
 * and retrieved from these lists, check CopyFromSequence documentation.
 *
 * The head of the data is represented by m_firstByteSeq, and it is returned by
 * HeadSequence(). The last byte is returned by TailSequence(). In this class,
 * we also store the size (in bytes) of the packets inside the SentList in the
 * variable m_sentSize.
 *
 * SACK management
 * ---------------
 *
 * The SACK information is usually saved in a data structure referred as
 * scoreboard. In this implementation, the scoreboard is developed on top of
 * the existing classes. In particular, instead of keeping raw pointers to
 * packets in TcpTxBuffer we added the capability to store some flags
 * associated with every segment sent. This is done through the use of the
 * class TcpTxItem: instead of storing a list of packets, we store a list of
 * TcpTxItem. Each item has different flags (check the corresponding
 * documentation) and maintaining the scoreboard is a matter of travelling the
 * list and set the SACK flag on the corresponding segment sent.
 *
 * Item properties
 * ---------------
 *
 * An item (that represent a segment in flight) is not considered in flight
 * anymore when it is marked lost or sacked. A sacked item represents an
 * item which is received by the other end, but it is still impossible
 * to delete from the list because other pieces are missing at the other
 * end. A lost item never reached the other end, and retransmission is probably
 * needed. Other properties are retransmitted, that indicates if an item was
 * retransmitted, and the sequence number of the first byte of the packet. When
 * a segment is sent for the first time, only the sequence number is set, and
 * all the remaining properties are set to false. If an item is explicitly
 * sacked by the receiver, we mark it as such. Each time we receive updated
 * sack information from the other end, we perform a check to evaluate the
 * segments that can be lost (\see UpdateLostCount), and we set the flags
 * accordingly.
 *
 * Management of bytes in flight
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * Since this class manages all the output segments and the scoreboard, we can
 * do calculations about the number of bytes in flights. Earlier versions of
 * this class used algorithms copied from RFC 6675. They were inefficient
 * because they required a complete walk into the list of sent segments each
 * time a simple question, such as "Is this sequence lost?" or "How many bytes
 * are in flight?". Therefore, the class has been updated keeping in
 * consideration the RFCs (including RFC 4898) and the Linux operating
 * system. As a reference, we kept the older methods for calculating the
 * bytes in flight and if a segment is lost, renaming them as "RFC" version
 * of the methods. To have a look how the calculations are made, please see
 * BytesInFlight method.
 *
 * Lost segments
 * -------------
 *
 * After the sender receives a new SACK block, it updates the amount of segment
 * that it considers as lost, following the specifications made in RFC 6675
 * (for more detail please see the method UpdateLostCount). In case of SACKless
 * connection, the TcpSocketImplementation should provide hints through
 * the MarkHeadAsLost and AddRenoSack methods.

   \endverbatim
   *
   * The case 1 is easy to manage: the requested block is exactly a packet
   * already stored. If one value (seq or seq + numBytes) does not align
   * to a packet boundary, or when both values does not align (case 2), it is
   * a bit more complex.
   *
   * Basically, we have two possible operations:
   *
   *  - fragment : split an existing packet in two
   *  - merge    : merge two existing packets in one
   *
   * and we reduce case (2) to case (1) through sequentially applying fragment
   * or merge. For instance:
   *
   *\verbatim
      |------|
      |      |
      |------|

      ^ ^  ^ ^
      | |  | |
  start |  | |
        |  | end
       seq |
           seq + numBytes
   \endverbatim
   *
   * To reduce to case (1), we need to perform two fragment operations:
   *
   * - fragment (start, seq)
   * - fragment (seq + numBytes, end)
   *
   * After these operations, the requested block is exactly the resulting packet.
   * Merge operation is required when the requested block span over two (or more)
   * existing packets.
   *
   * While this could be extremely slow in the worst possible scenario (one big
   * packet which is split in small packets for transmission, and merged for
   * re-transmission) that scenario is unlikely during a TCP transmission (since
   * MSS can change, but it is stable, and retransmissions do not happen for
