 * \class Ipv6AddressHelper
 * \brief Helper class to auto-assign global IPv6 unicast addresses
 *
 * Assign global unicast IPv6 addresses based on \RFC{4291} definition.

 *   <---prefix of length n--->
 * 
 * This class handles the following quantities.
 * 1) The "network" which covers the 64 bit union of the global routing
 *    prefix and the subnet ID
 * 2) the "prefix" length "n" which demarcates the global routing prefix
 *    and the subnet ID
 * 3) the "base" which is the initial 64-bit interface ID.
 *
 * The names "network", "prefix" and "base" are chosen to be consistent 
 * with a similar address helper for IPv4. 
 *
 * This helper class allows users to set or reset the network and
 * interface components, and call "NewAddress ()" to sequentially increment
 * the interface ID, and call "NewNetwork ()" to allocate a new subnet
 * (until the subnet ID quantity rolls over).  A call to NewNetwork ()
 * that causes the subnet ID to roll over will trigger an assertion.  
 * 
 * By default, the prefix is 32 bits and the network is '2001:db8::/32'
 * (\RFC{5156} section 2.6 Documentation prefix).  The prefix may range
 * from length 0 to 64, with the value 64 having a special meaning that
 * no subnet ID boundary is enforced (equivalent to value 0).
 * 
 * There are two variants of interface ID supported (\RFC{4291}, Sec. 2.5.1)
 * The default is a "local" scope, but a "universal" scoped ID may be
 * formed by calling "NewAddress (Address addr)" with a 48-bit MAC address.
 * If this method is called, the addressed returned will include a
 * modified EUI-64-format identifier created from the MAC address as 
 * specified in \RFC{4291}.
 *
 * BEWARE: the underlying implementation acts as a Singleton.
 * In other terms, two different instances of Ipv6AddressHelper will
 * pick IPv6 numbers from the same pool. Changing the network in one of them
 * will also change the network in the other instances.
