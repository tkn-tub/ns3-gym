 * are part of a global address space.  If you have a complicated address 
 * assignment situation you may want to look at the Ipv4AddressGenerator which
 * does recognize that IP address and network number generation is part of a
 * global problem.  Ipv4AddressHelper is a simple class to make simple problems

 * We do call into the global address generator to make sure that there are
 * no duplicate addresses generated.
