 * \class VirtualNetDevice
 * \brief A virtual device, similar to Linux TUN/TAP interfaces.
 *
 * A VirtualNetDevice is a "virtual" NetDevice implementation which
 * delegates to a user callback (see method SetSendFromCallback()) the
 * task of actually transmitting a packet.  It also allows the user
 * code to inject the packet as if it had been received by the
 * VirtualNetDevice.  Together, these features allow one to build tunnels.
 * For instance, by transmitting packets into a UDP socket we end up
 * building an IP-over-UDP-over-IP tunnel, or IP-over-IP tunnels.
 *
 * The same thing could be accomplished by subclassing NetDevice
 * directly.  However, VirtualNetDevice is usually much simpler to program
 * than a NetDevice subclass.
