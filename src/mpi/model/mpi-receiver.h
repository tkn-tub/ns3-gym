 * MpiInterface::ReceiveMessages () needs to send packets to a NetDevice
 * Receive() method.  Since each NetDevice's Receive() method is specific
 * to the derived class, and since we do not know whether such a NetDevice
 * is MPI-capable, we aggregate one of these objects to each MPI-capable
 * device.  In addition, we must hook up a NetDevice::Receive() method
 * to the callback.  So the two steps to enable MPI capability are to
 * aggregate this object to a NetDevice, and to set the callback.
