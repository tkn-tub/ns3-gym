/**
 * \ingroup openflow
 * \brief A net device that switches multiple LAN segments via an OpenFlow-compatible flow table
 *
 * The OpenFlowSwitchNetDevice object aggregates multiple netdevices as ports
 * and acts like a switch. It implements OpenFlow-compatibility,
 * according to the OpenFlow Switch Specification v0.8.9
 * <www.openflowswitch.org/documents/openflow-spec-v0.8.9.pdf>.
 * It implements a flow table that all received packets are run through.
 * It implements a connection to a controller via a subclass of the Controller class,
 * which can send messages to manipulate the flow table, thereby manipulating
 * how the OpenFlow switch behaves.
 *
 * There are two controllers available in the original package. DropController
 * builds a flow for each received packet to drop all packets it matches (this
 * demonstrates the flow table's basic implementation), and the LearningController
 * implements a "learning switch" algorithm (see 802.1D), where incoming unicast
 * frames from one port may occasionally be forwarded throughout all other ports,
 * but usually they are forwarded only to a single correct output port.
 *
 * \attention The Spanning Tree Protocol part of 802.1D is not
 * implemented.  Therefore, you have to be careful not to create
 * bridging loops, or else the network will collapse.
 *
 * \attention Each NetDevice used must only be assigned a Mac Address, adding it
 * to an Ipv4 or Ipv6 layer will cause an error. It also must support a SendFrom
 * call.
