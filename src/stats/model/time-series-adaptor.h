 * a tuple of two double values.  The first is a timestamp which may
 * be set to different resolutions (e.g. Seconds, Milliseconds, etc.)
 * in the future, but which presently is hardcoded to Seconds.  The second
 * is the conversion of
 * a non-double value to a double value (possibly with loss of precision).

 * It should be noted that time series adaptors convert
 * Simulation Time objects to double values in its output.
