/**
 * \ingroup point-to-point
 * \brief Packet header for PPP
 *
 * This class can be used to add a header to PPP packet.  Currently we do not
 * implement any of the state machine in RFC 1661, we just encapsulate the
 * inbound packet send it on.  The goal here is not really to implement the
 * point-to-point protocol, but to encapsulate our packets in a known protocol
 * so packet sniffers can parse them.
 *
 * if PPP is transmitted over a serial link, it will typically be framed in
 * some way derivative of IBM SDLC (HDLC) with all that that entails.
 * Thankfully, we don't have to deal with all of that -- we can use our own
 * protocol for getting bits across the serial link which we call an ns3 
 * Packet.  What we do have to worry about is being able to capture PPP frames
 * which are understandable by Wireshark.  All this means is that we need to
 * teach the PcapWriter about the appropriate data link type (DLT_PPP = 9),
 * and we need to add a PPP header to each packet.  Since we are not using
 * framed PPP, this just means prepending the sixteen bit PPP protocol number
 * to the packet.  The ns-3 way to do this is via a class that inherits from
 * class Header.
