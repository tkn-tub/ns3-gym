 *
 * \brief Functions to help clean up when a fatal error
 * is encountered.
 *
 * The functions in this group are used to perform
 * limited clean up, like flushing active streams, when
 * fatal errors are encountered (through assertion fail,
 * calls to NS_ABORT_* or calls to NS_FATAL_ERROR).
 *
 * Currently, other than flushing active ostreams, these
 * functions does not interfere with outside memory.  There
 * is still a residual risk that invalid ostream
 * pointers may be present, and may corrupt the memory
 * on the attempt to execute the flush() function.

/**
 * \ingroup fatal

 * \brief Fatal error reporting implementation.
 *
 * When this macro is hit at runtime the error details will
 * printed to \c stderr, including the supplied \c msg,
 * and the file name and line number.  Optionally, if \c fatal is true,
 * the macro will invoke \c std::terminate().  If \c fatal is false,
 * the invoking function should return an error code to its caller,
 * which is expected to call NS_FATAL_ERROR to cause termination.
 *
 * \param [in] msg The error message to print, if not empty.
 * \param [in] fatal Call \c std::terminate() if true.
 *
 * This macro is enabled unconditionally in all builds,
 * including debug and optimized builds.
