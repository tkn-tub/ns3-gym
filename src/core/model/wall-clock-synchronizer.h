/**
 * @ingroup realtime
 * @brief Class used for synchronizing the simulation events to a real-time
 * "wall clock" using Posix clock functions.
 *
 * Enable this synchronizer using:
 *
 * @code
 *   DefaultValue::Bind ("Synchronizer", "WallClockSynchronizer");
 * @endcode
 *
 * before calling any simulator functions.
 *
 * There are a couple of more issues at this level.  Posix clocks provide
 * access to several clocks we could use as a wall clock.  We don't care about
 * time in the sense of 04:30 CEST, we care about some piece of hardware that
 * ticks at some regular period.  The most accurate posix clock in this
 * respect is the @c CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID clock.  This is a high-resolution
 * register in the CPU.  For example, on Intel machines this corresponds to
 * the timestamp counter (TSC) register.  The resolution of this counter will
 * be on the order of nanoseconds.
 *
 * Now, just because we can measure time in nanoseconds doesn't mean we can
 * put our process to sleep to nanosecond resolution.  We are eventually going
 * to use the function @c clock_nanosleep() to sleep until a simulation Time
 * specified by the caller. 
 *
 * @todo Add more on jiffies, sleep, processes, etc.
 *
 * @internal
 * Nanosleep takes a <tt>struct timeval</tt> as an input so we have to
 * deal with conversion between Time and @c timeval here.
 * They are both interpreted as elapsed times.
