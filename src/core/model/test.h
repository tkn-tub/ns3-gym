/**

 * \brief Test that actual and expected (limit) values are equal to plus
 * or minus some tolerance and report and abort if not.
 *
 * Check to see if the expected (limit) value is equal to the actual value found
 * in a test case to some tolerance.  This is not the same thing as asking if
 * two floating point are equal to within some epsilon, but is useful for that
 * case.  This assertion is geared toward more of a measurement problem.
 * Consider measuring a physical rod of some kind that you have ordered.
 * You need to determine if it is "good."  You want to measure the rod
 * to an arbitrary precision of sixteen significant figures, you will
 * measure the rod to determine if its length is within the tolerances
 * you provided.  For example, 12.00 inches plus or minus .005 inch
 * may be just fine.
 * 
 * In ns-3, you might want to measure a signal to noise ratio and check to see
 * if the answer is what you expect.  If you naively measure (double)1128.93 and
 * compare this number with a constant 1128.93 you are almost certainly going to
 * have your test fail because of floating point rounding errors.  We provide a
 * floating point comparison function ns3::TestDoubleIsEqual() but you will 
 * probably quickly find that is not what you want either.  It may turn out to
 * be the case that when you measured an snr that printed as 1128.93, what was 
 * actually measured was something more like 1128.9287653857625442 for example.
 * Given that the double epsilon is on the order of 0.0000000000000009,
 * you would need to provide sixteen significant figures of expected value
 * for this kind of test to pass even with a typical test for floating point
 * "approximate equality."  That is clearly not required or desired.
 * You really want to be able to provide 1128.93 along with a tolerance
 * just like you provided 12 inches +- 0.005 inch above.
 *
 * This assertion is designed for real measurements by taking into account
 * measurement tolerances.  By doing so it also automatically compensates for 
 * floating point rounding errors.    If you really want to check floating point
 * equality down to the numeric_limits<double>::epsilon () range, consider
 * using ns3::TestDoubleIsEqual().
 *
 * \note Mixing signed and unsigned types can lead to misleading results.
 *
 * The message is interpreted as a stream, for example:
 *
 * \code
 * NS_TEST_ASSERT_MSG_EQ_TOL (snr, 1128.93, 0.005, "wrong snr (" << snr << ") in test");
 * \endcode
 *
 * is legal.
 * 
 * \param actual Expression for the actual value found during the test.
 * \param limit Expression for the expected value of the test.
 * \param tol Tolerance of the test.
 * \param msg Message that is output if the test does not pass.

 * two floating point are equal to within some epsilon, but is useful for that
 * case.  This assertion is geared toward more of a measurement problem.
 * Consider measuring a physical rod of some kind that you have ordered.
 * You need to determine if it is "good."  You want to measure the rod
 * to an arbitrary precision of sixteen significant figures, you will
 * measure the rod to determine if its length is within the tolerances
 * you provided.  For example, 12.00 inches plus or minus .005 inch
 * may be just fine.
 * 
 * In ns-3, you might want to measure a signal to noise ratio and check to see
 * if the answer is what you expect.  If you naively measure (double)1128.93 and
 * compare this number with a constant 1128.93 you are almost certainly going to
 * have your test fail because of floating point rounding errors.  We provide a
 * floating point comparison function ns3::TestDoubleIsEqual() but you will 
 * probably quickly find that is not what you want either.  It may turn out to
 * be the case that when you measured an snr that printed as 1128.93, what was 
 * actually measured was something more like 1128.9287653857625442 for example.
 * Given that the double epsilon is on the order of 0.0000000000000009,
 * you would need to provide sixteen significant figures of expected value
 * for this kind of test to pass even with a typical test for floating point
 * "approximate equality."  That is clearly not required or desired.
 * You really want to be able to provide  1128.93 along with a tolerance
 * just like you provided 12 inches +- 0.005 inch above.
 *
 * This assertion is designed for real measurements by taking into account
 * measurement tolerances.  By doing so it also automatically compensates for 
 * floating point rounding errors.    If you really want to check floating point
