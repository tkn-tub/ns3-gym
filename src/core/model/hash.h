/**
 *  \ingroup hash
 *
 *  \brief Generic Hash function interface.
 *
 *  This class provides a generic interface for computing hashes
 *  of buffers.  Various getters return hashes of different lengths.
 *
 *  Call clear() between calls to the getter to reset the
 *  internal state and hash each buffer separately.
 *
 *  If you don't call clear() between calls to the getter
 *  you can hash successive buffers.  The final return value
 *  will be the cumulative hash across all calls.
 *
 *  The choice of hash function can be made at construction by
 *    \code
 *    Hasher hasher = Hasher ( Create<Hash::Function::Fnv1a> () );
 *    uint32_t hash = Hasher.GetHash32 (data);
 *    \endcode
 *
 *  The available implementations are documented in \ref hash.
 *  The default implementation is Murmur3.  FNV1a is also available.
 *
 *  In addition to this class interface, global functions are
 *  defined which use the default hash implementation.
 *
 * \internal
 *
 *  Would be nice to offer longer hashes.  \c uint128_t looks doable,
 *  except that our fallback \c int64x64_t implementation doesn't
 *  offer \c unsigned.
 *
 *  Longer hashes require returning a byte buffer of some sort,
 *  but our \ref Buffer class seems a bit overkill for this case.
