/**
 * \ingroup traffic-control
 *
 * \brief Traffic control layer definition
 *
 * This layer stays between NetDevices (L2) and any network protocol (e.g. IP).
 * When enabled, it is responsible to analyze packets and to perform actions on
 * them: the most common is scheduling.
 *
 * Basically, we manage both IN and OUT directions (sometimes called RX and TX,
 * respectively). The OUT direction is easy to follow, since it involves
 * direct calls: upper layer (e.g. IP) calls the Send method on an instance of
 * this class, which then calls the Enqueue method of the QueueDisc associated
 * with the device. The Dequeue method of the QueueDisc finally calls the Send
 * method of the NetDevice.
 *
 * The IN direction uses a little trick to reduce dependencies between modules.
 * In simple words, we use Callbacks to connect upper layer (which should register
 * their Receive callback through RegisterProtocolHandler) and NetDevices.
 *
 * An example of the IN connection between this layer and IP layer is the following:
 *\verbatim
  Ptr<TrafficControlLayer> tc = m_node->GetObject<TrafficControlLayer> ();

  NS_ASSERT (tc != 0);

  m_node->RegisterProtocolHandler (MakeCallback (&TrafficControlLayer::Receive, tc),
                                   Ipv4L3Protocol::PROT_NUMBER, device);
  m_node->RegisterProtocolHandler (MakeCallback (&TrafficControlLayer::Receive, tc),
                                   ArpL3Protocol::PROT_NUMBER, device);

  tc->RegisterProtocolHandler (MakeCallback (&Ipv4L3Protocol::Receive, this),
                               Ipv4L3Protocol::PROT_NUMBER, device);
  tc->RegisterProtocolHandler (MakeCallback (&ArpL3Protocol::Receive, PeekPointer (GetObject<ArpL3Protocol> ())),
                               ArpL3Protocol::PROT_NUMBER, device);
  \endverbatim
 * On the node, for IPv4 and ARP packet, is registered the
 * TrafficControlLayer::Receive callback. At the same time, on the TrafficControlLayer
 * object, is registered the callbacks associated to the upper layers (IPv4 or ARP).
 *
 * When the node receives an IPv4 or ARP packet, it calls the Receive method
 * on TrafficControlLayer, that calls the right upper-layer callback once it
 * finishes the operations on the packet received.
 *
 * Discrimination through callbacks (in other words: what is the right upper-layer
 * callback for this packet?) is done through checks over the device and the
 * protocol number.
