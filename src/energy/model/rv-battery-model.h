 * \brief Rakhmatov Vrudhula non-linear battery model.
 *
 * This (energy source) model implements an analytical non-linear battery model.
 * It is capable of capturing load capacity and recovery effects of batteries.
 * Batteries are characterized by 2 parameters, alpha and beta, which can both
 * be obtained from the discharge curve of the batteries.
 *
 * The model is developed by Daler Rakhmatov & Sarma Vrudhula in: "Battery
 * Lifetime Prediction for Energy-Aware Computing" and "An Analytical High-Level
 * Battery Model for Use in Energy Management of Portable Electronic Systems".
 *
 * The real-time algorithm is developed by Matthias Handy & Dirk Timmermann in:
 * "Simulation of Mobile Wireless Networks with Accurate Modeling of non-linear
 * battery effects". The real-time algorithm is modified by the authors of this
 * code for improved accuracy and reduced computation (sampling) overhead.
