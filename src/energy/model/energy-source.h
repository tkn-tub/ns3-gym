/**
 * \ingroup energy
 *
 * \brief Energy source base class.
 *
 * This is the base class for energy sources. Energy sources keep track of
 * remaining energy. Device energy models will be updating the remaining energy
 * in the energy source. The energy source itself does not update the remaining
 * energy. Energy source also keeps a list of device energy models installed on
 * the same node. When the remaining energy level reaches 0, the energy source
 * will notify all device energy models stored in the list.
 *
 * EnergySource provides 2 types of interfaces for DeviceEnergyModels to update
 * the remaining energy stored in EnergySource:
 *  -Direct energy update interface (Joules):
 *    DecreaseRemainingEnergy
 *    IncreaseRemainingEnergy
 *  -Indirect energy update interface (Current):
 *    UpdateEnergySource
 * Direct energy update interface will decrease/increase energy from the source
 * directly (in Joules). Direct energy update interface is typically used by
 * simple DeviceEnergyModel which knows only average power consumption for each
 * of its state.
 * Indirect energy update interface uses the total current cumulated from all
 * DeviceEnergyModel to calculate energy to decrease from the source. Indirect
 * energy update interface is typically used by DeviceEnergyModel who knows its
 * current draw for each of its states. Nonlinear EnergySource also uses this
 * interface.
 *
 * Unit of energy is chosen as Joules since energy models typically calculate
 * energy as (time in seconds * power in Watts). If the energy source stores
 * energy in different units (eg. kWh), a simple converter function should
 * suffice.
