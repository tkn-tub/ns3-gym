The ``src/fd-net-device`` module provides the ``FdNetDevice`` class, 
which is able to read and write traffic using a file descriptor 
provided by the user.  This file descriptor can be associated to a TAP 
device, to a raw socket, to a user space process generating/consuming 
traffic, etc.  
The user has full freedom to define how external traffic is generated 
and |ns3| traffic is consumed. 

Different mechanisms to associate a simulation to external traffic can 
be provided through helper classes.  Three specific helpers are provided:

* EmuFdNetDeviceHelper (to associate the |ns3| device with a physical device
  in the host machine)
* TapFdNetDeviceHelper (to associate the ns-3 device with the file descriptor 
  from a tap device in the host machine)
* PlanteLabFdNetDeviceHelper (to automate the creation of tap devices in 
  PlanetLab nodes, enabling |ns3| simulations that can send and receive 
  traffic though the Internet using PlanetLab resource.

Model Description
*****************

The source code for this module lives in the directory ``src/fd-net-device``.

The FdNetDevice is a special type of |ns3| NetDevice that reads traffic
to and from a file descriptor.  That is, unlike pure simulation NetDevice
objects that write frames to and from a simulated channel, this FdNetDevice
directs frames out of the simulation to a file descriptor.  The file
descriptor may be associated to a Linux TUN/TAP device, to a socket, or
to a user-space process. 

It is up to the user of this device to provide a file descriptor.  The
type of file descriptor being provided determines what is being
modelled.  For instance, if the file descriptor provides a raw socket
to a WiFi card on the host machine, the device being modelled is a 
WiFi device.

From the conceptual "top" of the device looking down, it looks to the
simulated node like a device supporting a 48-bit IEEE MAC address that
can be bridged, supports broadcast, and uses IPv4 ARP or IPv6 Neighbor 
Discovery, although these attributes can be tuned on a per-use-case basis.

Design
======

The FdNetDevice implementation makes use of a reader object,
extended from the ``FdReader`` class in the |ns3| ``src/core`` module, 
which manages a separate thread from the main |ns3| execution thread, in order 
to read traffic from the file descriptor.

Upon invocation of the ``StartDevice`` method, the reader object is initialized 
and starts the reading thread.
Before device start, a file descriptor must be previously associated to the 
FdNetDevice with the ``SetFileDescriptor`` invocation.

The creation and configuration of the file descriptor can be left to a 
number of helpers, described in more detail below. When this is done, the
invocation of ``SetFileDescriptor`` is responsibility of 
the helper and must not be directly invoked by the user.

Upon reading an incoming frame from the file descriptor, the reader 
will pass the frame to the ``ReceiveCallback`` method, whose 
task it is to schedule the reception of the frame by the device as a 
|ns3| simulation event. Since the new frame is passed from the reader 
thread to the main |ns3| simulation thread, thread-safety issues 
are avoided by using the ``ScheduleWithContext`` call instead of the 
regular ``Schedule`` call.

In order to avoid overwhelming the scheduler when the incoming data rate 
is too high, a counter is kept with the number of frames that are currently
scheduled to be received by the device. If this counter reaches the value
given by the ``RxQueueSize`` attribute in the device, then the new frame will
be dropped silently.  

The actual reception of the new frame by the device occurs when the 
scheduled ``FordwarUp`` method is invoked by the simulator. 
This method acts as if a new frame had arrived from a channel attached
to the device. The device then decapsulates the frame, removing any layer 2
headers, and forwards it to upper network stack layers of the node. 
The ``ForwardUp`` method will remove the frame headers,
according to the frame encapsulation type defined by the ``EncapsulationMode``
attribute, and invoke the receive callback passing an IP packet.

An extra header, the PI header, can be present when the file descriptor is 
associated to a TAP device that was created without setting the IFF_NO_PI flag.
This extra header is removed if ``EncapsulationMode`` is set to DIXPI value.

In the opposite direction, packets generated inside the simulation that are 
sent out through the device, will be passed to the ``Send`` method, which  
will in turn invoke the ``SendFrom`` method. The latter method will add the 
necessary layer 2 headers, and simply write the newly created frame to the 
file descriptor.  


Scope and Limitations
=====================

Users of this device are cautioned that there is no flow control
across the file descriptor boundary, when using in emulation mode.
That is, in a Linux system, if the speed of writing network packets 
exceeds the ability of the underlying physical device to buffer the 
packets, backpressure up to the writing application will be applied
to avoid local packet loss.  No such flow control is provided across
the file descriptor interface, so users must be aware of this limitation.

As explained before, the RxQueueSize attribute limits the number of packets
that can be pending to be received by the device. 
Frames read from the file descriptor while the number of pending packets is 
in its maximum will be silently dropped.

The mtu of the device defaults to the Ethernet II MTU value. However, helpers
are supposed to set the mtu to the right value to reflect the characteristics
of the network interface associated to the file descriptor.
If no helper is used, then the responsibility of setting the correct mtu value
for the device falls back to the user.
The size of the read buffer on the file descriptor reader is set to the 
mtu value in the ``StartDevice`` method.

The FdNetDevice class currently supports three encapsulation modes,
DIX for Ethernet II frames, LLC for 802.2 LLC/SNAP frames, 
and DIXPI for Ethernet II frames with an additional TAP PI header.
This means that traffic traversing the file descriptor is expected to be 
Ethernet II compatible. 
Attaching an FdNetDevice to a wireless interface is possible as long as the 
driver provides Ethernet II frames to the socket API. 
Note that to associate a FdNetDevice to a wireless card in ad-hoc mode, 
the MAC address of the device must be set to the real card MAC address, else 
any incoming traffic a fake MAC address will be discarded by the driver.

As mentioned before, three helpers are provided with the fd-net-device module.
Each individual helper (file descriptor type) may have platform
limitations.  For instance, threading, real-time simulation mode, and the
ability to create TUN/TAP devices are prerequisites to using the
provided helpers.  Support for these modes can be found in the output
of the ``waf configure`` step, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: text

   Threading Primitives          : enabled
   Real Time Simulator           : enabled
   Emulated Net Device           : enabled
   Tap Bridge                    : enabled


It is important to mention that while testing the ``FdNetDevice`` we have found 
an upper bound limit for TCP throughput when using 1Gb Ethernet links of 60Mbps. 
This limit is most likely due to the processing power of the computers involved 
in the tests.


Usage
*****

The usage pattern for this type of device is similar to other net devices
with helpers that install to node pointers or node containers.
When using the base ``FdNetDeviceHelper`` the user is responsible for 
creating and setting the file descriptor by himself.

::

   FdNetDeviceHelper fd;
   NetDeviceContainer devices = fd.Install (nodes);

   // file descriptor generation
   ...
   
   device->SetFileDescriptor (fd);


Most commonly a FdNetDevice will be used to interact with the host system.
In these cases it is almost certain that the user will want to run in real-time 
emulation mode, and to enable checksum computations.  
The typical program statements are as follows:

::

   GlobalValue::Bind ("SimulatorImplementationType", StringValue ("ns3::RealtimeSimulatorImpl"));
   GlobalValue::Bind ("ChecksumEnabled", BooleanValue (true));

The easiest way to set up an experiment that interacts with a Linux host
system is to user the ``Emu`` and ``Tap`` helpers.
Perhaps the most unusual part of these helper implementations
relates to the requirement for executing some of the code with super-user
permissions. Rather than force the user to execute the entire simulation as
root, we provide a small "creator" program that runs as root and does any
required high-permission sockets work. The easiest way to set the right 
privileges for the "creator" programs, is by enabling the ``--enable-sudo``
flag when performing ``waf configure``.

We do a similar thing for both the ``Emu`` and the ``Tap`` devices.  The
high-level view is that the ``CreateFileDescriptor`` method creates a local interprocess
(Unix) socket, forks, and executes the small creation program. The small
program, which runs as suid root, creates a raw socket and sends back the raw
socket file descriptor over the Unix socket that is passed to it as a parameter.
The raw socket is passed as a control message (sometimes called ancillary data)
of type SCM_RIGHTS.


Helpers
=======

EmuFdNetDeviceHelper
####################

The EmuFdNetDeviceHelper creates a raw socket to an underlying physical
device, and provides the socket descriptor to the FdNetDevice.  This
allows the |ns3| simulation to read frames from and write frames to
a network device on the host.

The emulation helper permits to transparently integrate a simulated
|ns3| node into a network composed of real nodes.

This helper replaces the functionality of the ``EmuNetDevice`` found in
|ns3| prior to ns-3.17, by bringing this type of device into the common
framework of the FdNetDevice.  The ``EmuNetDevice`` was deprecated
in favor of this new helper.

The device is configured to perform
MAC spoofing to separate simulation network traffic from other
network traffic that may be flowing to and from the host.

One can use this helper in a testbed situation where the host on
which the simulation is running has a specific interface of interest which
drives the testbed hardware. You would also need to set this specific interface
into promiscuous mode and provide an appropriate device name to the |ns3|
simulation.  Additionally, hardware offloading of segmentation and checksums 
should be disabled.  

The helper only works if the underlying interface is up and in
promiscuous mode. Packets will be sent out over the device, but we use MAC
spoofing. The MAC addresses will be generated (by default) using the
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) 00:00:00 as a base. This vendor code 
is not assigned to any organization and so should not conflict with any real
hardware.

It is always up to the user to determine that using these MAC addresses is okay
on your network and won't conflict with anything else (including another
simulation using such devices) on your network. If you are using the emulated
FdNetDevice configuration in separate simulations,
you must consider global MAC address
assignment issues and ensure that MAC addresses are unique across all
simulations. The emulated net device respects the MAC address provided in the
``Address`` attribute so you can do this manually. For larger simulations, you
may want to set the OUI in the MAC address allocation function.

Before invoking the ``Install`` method, the correct device name must be configured
on the helper using the ``SetDeviceName`` method. The device name is required to 
identify which physical device should be used to open the raw socket.

::

  EmuFdNetDeviceHelper emu;
  emu.SetDeviceName (deviceName);
  NetDeviceContainer devices = emu.Install (node);
  Ptr<NetDevice> device = devices.Get (0);
  device->SetAttribute ("Address", Mac48AddressValue (Mac48Address::Allocate ()));


TapFdNetDeviceHelper
####################

A Tap device is a special type of Linux device for which one end of the
device appears to the kernel as a virtual net_device, and the other
end is provided as a file descriptor to user-space.  This file descriptor
can be passed to the FdNetDevice.  Packets forwarded to the TAP device
by the kernel will show up in the FdNetDevice in |ns3|.

Users should note that this usage of TAP devices is different than that
provided by the TapBridge NetDevice found in ``src/tap-bridge``.
The model in this helper is as follows:

.. sourcecode:: text

 +-------------------------------------+

                                 |
                                 ------------ (Internet) -----                             


In the above, the configuration requires that the host be able to forward
traffic generated by the simulation to the Internet.

The model in TapBridge (in another module) is as follows:

.. sourcecode:: text

    |  Linux |

                                  |  device  |     |  device  |
                                  +----------+     +----------+
                                       ||               ||
                                  +---------------------------+
                                  |        ns-3 channel       |
                                  +---------------------------+


In the above, packets instead traverse |ns3| NetDevices and Channels.

The usage pattern for this example is that the user sets the
MAC address and either (or both) the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and masks
on the device, and the PI header if needed.  For example:

::

  TapFdNetDeviceHelper helper;
  helper.SetDeviceName (deviceName);
  helper.SetModePi (modePi);
  helper.SetTapIpv4Address (tapIp);
  helper.SetTapIpv4Mask (tapMask);
  ...
  helper.Install (node);


PlanetLabFdNetDeviceHelper
##########################

PlanetLab is a world wide distributed network testbed composed of 
nodes connected to the Internet. 
Running ns-3 simulations in PlanetLab nodes using the 
PlanetLabFdNetDeviceHelper allows to send simulated traffic generated by
ns-3 directly to the Internet. This setup can be useful to validate 
ns-3 Internet protocols or other future protocols implemented in ns-3.

To run experiments using PlanetLab nodes it is required to have a 
PlanetLab account. 
Only members of PlanetLab partner institutions can obtain such accounts
( for more information visit http://www.planet-lab.org/ or 
http://www.planet-lab.eu ).
Once the account is obtained, a PlanetLab `slice` must be requested in 
order to conduct experiments. 
A slice represents an experiment unit related to a group of PlanetLab users, 
and can be associated to virtual machines in different PlanetLab nodes.
Slices can also be customized by adding configuration tags to it 
(this is done by PlanetLab administrators).

The PlanetLabFdNetDeviceHelper creates TAP devices on PlanetLab nodes
using specific PlanetLab mechanisms (i.e. the vsys system), and 
associates the TAP device to a FdNetDevice in ns-3. 
The functionality provided by this helper is similar to that provided
by the FdTapNetDeviceHelper, except that the underlying mechanisms
to create the TAP device are different.

In order to be able to assign private IPv4 addresses to the TAP devices, 
account holders must request the `vsys_vnet` tag to be added to their slice
by PlanetLab administrators. 
The vsys_vnet tag is associated to private network segment and only addresses
from this segment can be used in experiments.

The syntax used to create a TAP device with this helper is similar to that
used for the previously described helpers:

::

  PlanetLabFdNetDeviceHelper helper;
  helper.SetTapIpAddress (tapIp);
  helper.SetTapMask (tapMask);
  ...
  helper.Install (node);


PlanetLab nodes have a Fedora based distribution, so ns-3 can be installed
following the instructions for ns-3 Linux installation.

Attributes
==========

The ``FdNetDevice`` provides a number of attributes:

* ``Address``:  The MAC address of the device
* ``Start``:  The simulation start time to spin up the device thread
* ``Stop``:  The simulation start time to stop the device thread
* ``EncapsulationMode``:  Link-layer encapsulation format
* ``RxQueueSize``:  The buffer size of the read queue on the file descriptor
    thread (default of 1000 packets)

``Start`` and ``Stop`` do not normally need to be specified unless the
user wants to limit the time during which this device is active.  
``Address`` needs to be set to some kind of unique MAC address if the
simulation will be interacting with other real devices somehow using
real MAC addresses.  Typical code:

::

   device->SetAttribute ("Address", Mac48AddressValue (Mac48Address::Allocate ()));

Output
======

Ascii and PCAP tracing is provided similar to the other |ns3| NetDevice
types, through the helpers, such as (e.g.):

::
    EmuFdNetDeviceHelper emu;
    NetDeviceContainer devices = emu.Install (node);
    ...
    emu.EnablePcap ("emu-ping", device, true);


The standard set of Mac-level NetDevice trace sources is provided.

* ``MaxTx``:  Trace source triggered when |ns3| provides the device with a 
  new frame to send
* ``MaxTxDrop``:  Trace source if write to file descriptor fails
* ``MaxPromiscRx``:  Whenever any valid Mac frame is received
* ``MaxRx``:  Whenever a valid Mac frame is received for this device
* ``Sniffer``:  Non-promiscuous packet sniffer
* ``PromiscSniffer``:  Promiscuous packet sniffer (for tcpdump-like traces)

Examples
========

Several examples are provided:

* ``dummy-network.cc``:  This simple example creates two nodes and 
  interconnects them with a Unix pipe by passing the file descriptors
  from the socketpair into the FdNetDevice objects of the respective nodes.
* ``realtime-dummy-network.cc``:  Same as dummy-network.cc but uses the real time
  simulator implementnation instead of the default one.
* ``fd2fd-onoff.cc``: This example is aimed at measuring the throughput of the 
  FdNetDevice in a pure simulation. For this purpose two FdNetDevices, attached to
  different nodes but in a same simulation, are connected using a socket pair.
  TCP traffic is sent at a saturating data rate. 
* ``fd-emu-onoff.cc``: This example is aimed at measuring the throughput of the 
  FdNetDevice  when using the EmuFdNetDeviceHelper to attach the simulated 
  device to a real device in the host machine. This is achieved by saturating
  the channel with TCP traffic. 
* ``fd-emu-ping.cc``: This example uses the EmuFdNetDeviceHelper to send ICMP
  traffic over a real channel.
* ``fd-emu-udp-echo.cc``: This example uses the EmuFdNetDeviceHelper to send UDP
  traffic over a real channel.
* ``fd-planetlab-ping.cc``: This example shows how to set up an experiment to send
  ICMP traffic from a PlanetLab node to the Internet.
* ``fd-tap-ping.cc``: This example uses the TapFdNetDeviceHelper to send ICMP
  traffic over a real channel.
