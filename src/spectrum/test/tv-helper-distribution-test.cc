/**
 * This test verifies the accuracy of the private GetRandomNumTransmitters()  
 * method in the TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper class. The method generates a 
 * random number corresponding to the number of TV transmitters to create based 
 * on the given location density (low, medium, or high) and maximum possible 
 * number of TV channels. Low density will generate a transmitter for between 
 * one (a single transmitter) and one third of the number of possible channels, 
 * medium density will generate a transmitter for between one third and two 
 * thirds, and high density will generate a transmitter for between two thirds 
 * and all of the possible channels. In this test, it is verified that the 
 * lower (1) and upper (max number of possible channels input) bounds are not 
 * exceeded and that the number of transmitters to be generated does not overlap 
 * between adjacent densities. For example, given 60 possible channels, for low 
 * density between 1 and 20 transmitters can be created, for medium density 
 * between 21 and 40 transmitters can be created, and for high density between 
 * 41 and 60 transmitters can be created (all inclusive). This is tested with 
 * various cases.
