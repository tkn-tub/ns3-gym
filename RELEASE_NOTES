Release 3.9
===========

Availability

This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-allinone-3.9.tar.bz2

New user-visible features
-------------------------

   - A reorganisation of the construction of Wi-Fi transmit rates has
     been undertaken with the aim of simplifying the task of
     supporting further IEEE 802.11 PHYs. This work has been completed
     under the auspices of Bug 871. A consequence of this work is that
     WifiModes have a new (hopefully future-proof) naming, and
     simulations which specify rates by name will need updating. The
     list of new rate names is given in the error message produced
     when an attempt is made to use any invalid rate name (including
     those that were previously valid).

   - A new OFDM error rate model for WiFi (NistErrorRateModel); this model
     has been validated in clear-channel testbed tests.  For 802.11b, it
     uses the same underlying model as the YansErrorRateModel, but it differs
     from YansErrorRateModel for OFDM modes (802.11a/g).  The default
     YansWifiPhyHelper has been changed to use this model.

   - A new NS-2 mobility trace reader supports BonnMotion, SUMO, TraNS, 
     etc. traces.

   - An energy model for nodes and devices, including an energy source
     model and device energy models allowing energy-aware devices
     to notify the energy source about energy consumption.  

   - Rocketfuel topology dataset support for existing topology reader
     Rocketfuel project: 
     http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel/

   - Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) model, split in to three parts, the 
     channel, PHY, and MAC models to enable researchers to model a variety 
     of underwater network scenarios.

Supported platforms
-------------------
ns-3.8 has been tested on the following platforms:
  - linux x86 gcc 4.4.0, 4.3.2, 4.2, 4.1.1, 4.1 and 3.4.6 (debug and optimized)

Not all ns-3 options are available on all platforms; consult the
wiki for more information:
http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/Installation

New user-visible features
-------------------------
  a) WiMAX net device: Allow to simulated IEEE 802.16 point to multi-point based networks 

  b) Distributed simulation for point-to-point networks using the Message 
     Passing Interface (MPI) standard.
    
  c) Matrix propagation loss model uses a two-dimensional matrix of path loss indexed 
     by source and destination nodes.

  d) Topology read system: Allows quick and easy creation of large topologies by reading 
     Inet or Orbis files

     socket option has been introduced to class Socket

  g) Object::DoStart: Users who need to complete their object setup at 
     the start of a simulation can override this virtual method, perform their 
     adhoc setup, and then, must chain up to their parent.

  h) Ipv4::IsDestinationAddress method added to support checks of whether a 
     destination address should be accepted as one of the host's own 
     addresses.  

  i) UniformDiscPositionAllocator added; distributes uniformly the nodes 
     within a disc of given radius. 

  j) ChannelNumber attribute added to YansWifiPhy. Now it is possible to 
     setup wifi channel using WifiPhyHelper::Set() method.

     (time, position) pairs

  l) 802.11p WiFi standards

API changes from ns-3.4
-----------------------
API changes for this release are documented in the file CHANGES.html.  The
internal API and composition of the IPv4 stack underwent significant
refactoring in this release cycle.

Known issues
------------
ns-3 build is known to fail on the following platforms:
  - gcc 3.3 and earlier
  - optimized builds on gcc 3.4.4 and 3.4.5
  - optimized builds on linux x86 gcc 4.0.x

Future releases
---------------
Our next release, which is expected to happen in 2 to 4 months from now, will
feature the merging of some of our projects currently in development including
fuller IPv6 support, some smaller features such as a new Global ARP 
package, and possibly a new Testing and Validation suite.

========================

The first ns-3 stable release
-----------------------------

This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3.1.tar.bz2

We dedicate this initial ns-3 release to our late contributor and friend, 
Federico Maguolo.

What is ns-3 ?
--------------

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and 
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility 
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which 
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties. 
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported 
models and/or to maintain existing models.

Where to get more information about ns-3
----------------------------------------

All the ns-3 documentation, is accessible from the ns-3 website: 
http://www.nsnam.org

Including, tutorials:
http://www.nsnam.org/tutorials.html

Supported platforms
-------------------

ns-3 is regularly tested on the following platforms:
  - linux x86 gcc 4.2, 4.1, and, 3.4.6.
  - linux x86_64 gcc 4.1.3, 4.2.1, 3.4.6
  - MacOS X ppc and x86
  - cygwin gcc 3.4.4 (debug only)

Known issues
------------

ns-3 is known to fail on the following platforms:
  - gcc 3.3 and earlier
  - optimized builds on gcc 3.4.4 and 3.4.5
  - optimized builds on linux x86 gcc 4.0.x

The IPv4 API defined in src/node/ipv4.h is expected to undergo major changes 
in preparation of the merge of the IPv6 API and implementation.

Future releases
---------------

Our next release, which is expected to happen in 2 to 4 months from now, will

scripting, IPv6, emulation, a statistics framework and synchronous posix 
sockets.

Release 3.0.13 (2008/06/02)
===========================
- point to point links generate ppp pcap traces
- point to point links support asymmetrical data rates.

- ARP cache now supports per-entry pending queues
- lots of bugfixes and implementation and API cleanups

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.  

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is 
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.
