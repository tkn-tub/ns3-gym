========================

The first ns-3 stable release
-----------------------------

This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3.1.tar.bz2

We dedicate this initial ns-3 release to our late contributor and friend, 
Federico Maguolo.

What is ns-3 ?
--------------

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and 
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility 
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which 
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties. 
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported 
models and/or to maintain existing models.

Release 3.0.13 (2008/06/02)
===========================
- point to point links generate ppp pcap traces
- point to point links support asymmetrical data rates.
- generate doxygen documentation for all attributes and trace sources
- add ConfigStore and GtkConfigStore to contrib module
- socket API now support tx and rx buffers: implemented for UDP and TCP
- ARP cache now supports per-entry pending queues
- lots of bugfixes and implementation and API cleanups

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.  

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is 
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.
